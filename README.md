# CrowdFund_Connect
CrowdFund Connect is a frontend-only crowdfunding platform built with React. Users can browse, filter, and donate to funding campaigns using a virtual coin system. Donations and coins are handled locally using React state/context, and all campaign data is stored in a local JSON file (no backend or API).
